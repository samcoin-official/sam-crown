Core Game Concept
SAM Crown Competition: King-of-the-hill style game where verified humans compete to hold the "SAM Crown" and earn SAM tokens while holding it. Inspired by World Flag app mechanics.
Key Files That Need Fixing

/src/components/AuthButton/index.tsx - World ID verification (has TypeScript errors)
/src/app/api/verify/route.ts - Backend verification (TypeScript errors)
/src/auth/index.ts - Simplified auth config (unused variable)

Technical Challenges

Multiple authentication systems conflicting (wallet auth vs World ID)
TypeScript/ESLint errors preventing builds
Need to follow official World documentation patterns exactly

Next Steps to Complete

Fix TypeScript build errors
Test working World ID verification
Implement crown competition mechanics
Add database for tracking crown holder and earnings
Create crown game UI with Samcoin character integration
Add 1-hour cooldown system between steal attempts
